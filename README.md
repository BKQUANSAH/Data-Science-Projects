9 projects have been uploaded.

Project 1 focuses on the use of python to perform the data analysis to find answers to questions that will help a Foodhub to improve its business.

Project 2 is on E-news Express, an online news portal, that aims to expand its business by acquiring new subscribers. This project explores the data and performs a statistical analysis (at a significance level of 5%) to determine the effectiveness of the new landing page in gathering new subscribers for the news portal by answering specific questions.

Project 3 is a machine learning problem with focus on supervised learning (Regression). A ML-based solution is used to develop a dynamic pricing strategy for used and refurbished devices for ReCell.

Project 4 is about the INN Hotels Group. It calls for a Machine Learning-based solution (using Logistic Regression and Decision Trees) that can help in predicting which booking is likely to be cancelled.

Project 5 is on the use of Ensemble Techniques to analyze the data provided by Easy Visa and, with the help of a classification model: Facilitate the process of visa approvals, and recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied based on the drivers that significantly influence the case status.

Project 6 is about renewable energy (Renewind). The objective is to build various classification models, tune them, and find the best one that will help identify failures so that the generators could be repaired before failing/breaking to reduce the overall maintenance cost.

Project 7 is on unsupervised learning for Trade and Ahead. It invloves analyzing data, grouping the stocks based on the attributes provided, and sharing insights about the characteristics of each group, using K-Means and Hierarchical clustering.

Project with BCG for GFC, focuses on developing an AI-powered chatbot to revolutionize financial data analysis. The project extracts key financial data for the last three fiscal years from the 10-K filings of Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple. Python was used to analyze this data, focusing on trends and insights that could inform the development of an AI-powered financial chatbot. The following financial metrics were extracted and used for the analysis: Total Revenue, Net Income, Total Assets, Total Liabilities, and Cash Flow from Operating Activities.

The MIT/IDSS project is on Customer Personality using K-Means and Hirarchical clustering.
